Trying a static website using GitHub as a Platform
Looks like this readme would only read by me so i think this is fine

List to do with this editable static website. The number aren't priorities. The easy one would be done first. Maybe few of it depend on the harder one. 

1. Find out to how post a markdown with mathjax, including choosing fonts (serifs, sans, and monospace).   
1.1 A simple mathjax option like in Jupyter would be suffice.

2. Create a minimalist CSS like Scientific American but static.   
2.1 Find a way to gain access website fonts, size, kerning, line space, and many other things about typography setting.   
2.2 Find a way to differentiate sections. Sections are header, body, and footer.   
2.3 Paint every media (images, videos, and interactive media) and find the fittest way to present them.   
2.4 Search a basic bootstrap for a CSS and exploit it.   

3. Search for a simple content management system.    
3.1 Search an algorithm /software to manage all content including images, videos, or even interactive media. This is actually pretty optional since we don't have many content thus we could rely on github and ourselves to manage content. 

4. Create a sitemap.    
4.1 List all what do you want to write, classify them.     
4.2 It would be nice if you have the draft in markdown format which could be checked by jupyter before uploading into website.     

5. Find out how to interactive media works in website. A simple one would be sufficient.      
5.1 Find out programming languange that any browser could render as an interactive media.     

*Is it use any markdown move?*

Notes:
I already use markdown and simple post management. Thanks to http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
