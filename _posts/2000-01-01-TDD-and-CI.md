1. My experience with TDD
1.1 A quick sprint
1.2 A time where we must create a unit test

2. Why TDD?
2.1 Software developing doctrine
2.2 TDD advantage and disadvantage
2.3 find the one that suits the requirement and team

3. Requirement for a continuous integration
3.1 Why CI need TDD?

4. TDD as a form of documentation
4.1 Code itself should be a documentation
4.2 Good TDD will make a good documentation at least for software developer

5. A safeguard for a continuous integration
5.1 Continous integration means more break
5.2 TDD as a easing process and save dev important dev hours

6. Unit test and Integration test
6.1 TDD needs both but at different level
6.2 For merging to development environment, we only need to check the unit test
6.3 For merging to production environement, we need to check the integration;
	make sure every important operation in a product works properly

7. CI/CD and TDD as a doctrine for scaling argument
7.1 Todays ever changing requests, CI/CD become a good model to achieve such requests
7.2 As we state in Documentation article, documenting product is useful tools for cutting dev hours.
7.3 CI/CD with TDD will decrease dev hours thus developer have more time developing more feature
7.4 In a scaling landscape, meeting the scaling from technology perspective need to met in every possible chance
