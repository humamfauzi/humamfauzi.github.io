description: Argue why we need better documentation and standardization of code before scaling up devs team
---

1. Language as a standard communication operation
1.1 Large team need a standard communication and process or protocol
1.2 Language; what we meant in this article
1.3 Finding a good balance between a rigid protocol and creative approach

2. Documentation as a handbook for multiple devs
2.1 Creating documentation need a set of standarized language
2.2 Refencing documentation in addressing problem or adding new feature

3. Standardization is where devs agree on something because it is a good practice and should be inherited by new one
3.1 New and Rigid standardization -- Determining flexibility of standardization [REF 1.3]
3.2 Good practice and code inheritence

5. Example web API handler

6. Example of database operation

7. Scaling argument as a main push point for a better documentation coverage and detailed standardization
7.1 Scaling means more problem and more additional feature. Docs and standardization helps you scale.
7.2 One place reference helps a team get in the same page.
7.3 People come and go, making sure the one who got in can adapt to the codebase as fast as s/he could.
7.4 There will be a time that knowing all is to much to bear. Sometimes it is enough to know where you could find the answer
