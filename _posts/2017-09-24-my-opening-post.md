Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. If you see this post, you probably wandering around too much.

$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$

$$ \begin{align} |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\ |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle \end{align} $$
