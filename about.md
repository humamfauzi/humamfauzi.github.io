Hi, my name is Humam Fauzi. Software engineer working in [Ritase](http://ritase.com), a Software-as-a-service startup in Indonesia. My current task is developing solution for managing logistics from but not limited to factory, port, warehouse, and store. One of our notable client is Nestle Indonesia. I traslate product requirement to technical implementation, ranging from application architecture down to documentation. I currently work with NodeJS but able to work in Golang and Python.
