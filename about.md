Hi, my name is Humam Fauzi. I am a general purpose software engineer based on Jakarta, Indonesia.
Currently held a senior software engineer in a Series A startup in Indonesia.
Interested in backend systems, data management, and research that improves product quality, business value and reach.

If you have a question or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue in the repository. I will try my best to reply

If you need a Backend Software Engineer or Data Analyst/Scientist/Cleaner but does not have
allocation for permanent position, you can contract me to do short work in certain amount of time.

You can always drop a message in **humam.fauzi.93@gmail.com**

### Tech Stack

My tech stack divided into three categories which is programming language, cloud service, and auxilary component. Different programming language serve different purposes. **Node JS**, with its javascript nature, is my main programming language for developing backend application. Familiarity, dynamic typing, and huge package support is few reasons why Node JS is my go to programming language. I also work closely with **python** for machine learning related tasks since it has several library support such as Numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Python is also packaged nicely for machine learning and data science purpoase by Jupyter. That is a note book that widely accepted as a tools for data scientist and machine learning engineers do their work. **Julia** is the programming language for computation. While it has several other functionality, Julia works best for, at least for me, in numerical calculation and other computationtal stuffs. I use it since my background as engineer.

My main cloud service provider is **Amazon Web Service** (AWS). As a proved cloud service provider, AWS provides many essentials platform to develop an app ranging from a storage, computation engine to database. I usually works around S3, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway and ECR. I have been using AWS to delivery products for two years.

Auxilary Component is a tool such as **MySQL**, **Git**, and **Docker**. It not central but it helps to know them in order to make an app better, from improving performance to reducing development viscosity.

#### Node JS / Typescript   
Building APIs for product that interact with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.
Use AWS SDK for interacting with services such as S3, SQS, and SNS. Use express for 
API interaction and Knex/Bookshelf for database interaction. Use Mocha and Chai for
testing. Able to work in vanilla javascript or typescript.

#### Python
Building machine learning (ML) system, data analysis and data wrangling. Use Sklearn
for traditional machine learning and Keras for deep learning. Building APIs so
outside party could interact with ML inference systems. Data manipulation done in pandas
and numerical calculation done in Numpy. Able to manipulate plotting using arViz, matplotlib,
and seaborn. Usually works with Jupyter Notebook but also able to work in python script.

#### Julia
Computational mathematics especially for matrix manipulation. Able to apply
numerical method to solve differential equations. Mainly done in Jupyter notebook.

#### Amazon Web Services
Understand and impelemnt Identity and Access Management service to secure and limit
access for AWS user. Query Cloudwatch logs for quick problems identification. APIs
integration with Node JS and Golang in services such as S3, SQS, and SNS. Use Lambda
for serverless BE and API Gateway for serving API.

#### MySQL
Create, read, update, and delete operation. Have a good undestanding of joins and subqueres. Able to
design data structure that fits product needs and MySQL schema. Evaluating structure and query optimisation. 

#### Git
Used for version controlling software development. Able to manage collaboration across team members.

#### Docker and Containerization
Building docker image that fulfill requirement, managing docker deployment, and monitoring docker.
